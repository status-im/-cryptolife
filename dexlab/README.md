## Inspiration
The Mobile payments market in China is exploding.

The payment apps and QR codes in retailers and other offline businesses have become ubiquitous in China, young consumers rarely carry a wallet or cash. In 2015 Chinese citizens transacted $1 trillion through mobile payments using QR codes. In 2017 it was $15.5 trillion. In 2020 it is forecast that Chinese consumers will transact $45 trillion through mobile payments, by which time the county will be pretty much cashless.

Solutions like WeChat Pay and Alipay are:
- Highly Centralized
- A Chinese Bank account is needed
- Not available for foreigners
- Highly censored

The 27 Oct 2018 China ruled that China’s Merchants are Legally Allowed to Accept Bitcoin and Crypto.

## What it does
xPay is an open alternative to mobile payment point of sale.
